Hi there!

Somehow you've managed to stumble upon my tiny blog, Welcome!

I'm a long walker, exploratory eater, soon to be great father that is fascinated by creative pursuits and would rather be traveling.  My chosen field has me mostly in front of a screen, a mindful Ruby Developer, fullstack with a burgeoning interest in Clojure.

If you are particularly interested and would like to contact me, please do!
