Hi there somebody! 

Somehow you've managed to stumble upon my tiny blog, Welcome!

The original idea of the name of this blog was just so that I could move on and just write.  If I write enough scraps, perhaps out of the great pile will emerge... ah you get the idea.  Essentially, it'll be good for something to commit to, track what I've done and generally something I could look back on and think, wow I can't believe I did that.  Lastly, I apologize if this does all look like a pile of scrap.

I'm a Software Developer by trade, and hoping to share something of interest on this blog, and for my benefit of getting better at writing by writing.[^huh]

If you are particularly interested and would like to contact me, please do!

[^huh]: Is this even a good sentence?  I'll probably change this a few times.
