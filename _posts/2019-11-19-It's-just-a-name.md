The original idea of the name of this blog was just so that I could move on and just write.  Yay, it's doing just that. 

If I write enough scraps, perhaps out of the great pile will emerge... ah you get the point.  Essentially, it'll be good for something to commit to, provide more concrete learnings, track what I've done and generally something I could look back on and think, wow what was I thinking.

Another reason is that it is so close to being DevOps, but not.  So it's already on trend.  If I followed this naming convention any closer it could have been DevBlogs, but there was no way I was going to have Blog in the title of a Blog.  DevWrites, DevPosts hmm... almost as [bad as DevOps](https://www.devsecopsdays.com/articles/its-just-a-name "How did DevOps arise?"). As Devops borrows Developer oriented concepts to approach Operational concerns, I wanted DevScraps to be a Developers approach to just get me writing.  So lower the expectations to the writing and you have scraps.  All of this is of course entirely an afterthought, and I probably had been reading up on DevOps too much at the time.

Lastly, I apologize if this does all look like a pile of scrap.
